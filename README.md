This is code for a workshop hosted at the [DraftKings Engineering Blog](https://medium.com/draftkings-engineering) co-created by Martin Ivanov, Dimitar Nanov, Vadym Kutsenko and David Musicant.

This code, and the exercises, will help you learn:

1. When to use Kafka vs a message queue such as RabbitMQ
1. The key components of Kafka and how to properly tune them
1. Creating highly efficient Consumers to handle the data streams
1. Creating well configured Producers that are optimized for high throughput
